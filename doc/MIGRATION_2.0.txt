MIGRATION Issues for upgrade from Mini-CMS Version 1 > rapila 2

1. Update and clear caches
2. Clear session (just in case)
3. run migration.sql changes required for update between local version and trunk (version 2)
4. r2442 > change to rapila, make release-1-devel MIGRATION changes >= r2442

5. switch base to rapila with: mini_cms_switch_svn_base.sh
6. optional, if you plan to use git: svn export to get rid of the .svn meta data to prepare for git


7. PageTree changes:
- run mini_cms_migrate_adjacency_list_to_nested_set.sh (@see migration.sql)
- remove parent_id, sort (@see migration.sql)

8. Identifier amendments:
- replace Page/PageString::getLongTitle() by getPageTitle(), identifiers 'long_title' by 'page_title'
- replace Pape/PageString::getTitle() by getPageTitle(), idendifiers 'title' by 'page_title', WATCH OUT, getTitle() is present in other classes as well

- getTree() is deprecated

9. Config file changes
- db_config.yml: spyc update requires simpler DSN, no mysqli adapter, no arguments to user, for reference @see base/config/db_config.yml

10. Replace 'BackendManager' by 'AdminManager'
Class has been renamed to reflect its new almightiness 

11. Navigation Changes
- Template identifiers renamed: it is no longer recommended to use relative links (because of breaking the preview manager). To that end, the link identifier has been renamed link_without_prefix and what was previously known as full_link is now just link.
How to migrate:
- if {{link_prefix}} was used: remove {{link_prefix}}.
- if full_link is used: rename to link.
- If link was used: probably safe.
